# Creating Extension Icons

You need to create three icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Quick Option: Use Online Generator

1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/ or similar
2. Upload/create a simple icon
3. Download the PNG files in the required sizes
4. Place them in this `icons/` folder

## Or Use a Simple Placeholder

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images. The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default icon.

## Temporary Solution

The extension will load even without icons - Chrome will just show a default puzzle piece icon.
